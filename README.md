<h1>Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines using Wireshark</h1>
In this tutorial, we observe various network traffic to and from Azure Virtual Machines with Wireshark as well as experiment with Network Security Groups. <br />

</p>

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop Acess Tool
- Various Command-Line Tools
- Network Protocols (ICMP, SSH, DHCP, DNS, RDP)
- Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)
- Ubuntu Server 20.04


<h2>Setting up your virtual environment </h2>
</h3>
</br>
<p>
  Acces Azure Portal, set up a new Resource Group inside Azure subscription.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  Create a Windows 10 virtual machine. I typically create the VM in (US) East US.
</p>
<p>
  While creating the VM, select the previously created Resource Group and allow it to create a new Virtual Network (Vnet) and Subnet. Make sure to use the password option under the <strong>Administrator Account</strong> section:
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  Create an Ubuntu virtual machine.
</p>
<p>
  While creating the VM, select the previously created Resource Group and allow it to create a new Virtual Network (Vnet) and Subnet. Make sure to use the password option under the <strong>Administrator Account</strong> section (not seen in image):
</p>

</p>
<p>
  Observe Your Virtual Network within Network Watcher:

<br />

<h2>ICMP Traffic Observation</h2>

<br />
<p>
  Remote into your Windows 10 Virtual Machine, install Wireshark, open it and filter for ICMP traffic only.
</p>

</p>
<p>
  Retrieve the private IP address of the Ubuntu VM and attempt to ping it from within the Windows 10 VM. Observe ping requests and replies within WireShark:
</p>

  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/3h9QSEY.png" height="75%" width="100%" alt="ICMP traffic - private IP"/>
</p>
<p>
  Attempt to ping a public website (such as www.google.com) and observe the traffic in WireShark:
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/YduMvc7.png" height="75%" width="100%" alt="ICMP traffic - public IP"/>
</p>
<p>
  Initiate a perpetual/non-stop ping from your Windows 10 VM to your Ubuntu VM:
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/bihftKK.png" height="75%" width="100%" alt="ICMP traffic - perpetual ping"/>
</p>
<p>
  Open the Network Security Group your Ubuntu VM is using and disable incoming (inbound) ICMP traffic, while back in the Windows 10 VM, observe the ICMP traffic in WireShark and the command line Ping activity:
</p>
<p>

  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/NjuUANI.png" height="75%" width="100%" alt="ICMP traffic - ICMP denied"/>
</p>
<p>
  Re-enable ICMP traffic for the Network Security Group in your Ubuntu VM and back in the Windows 10 VM, observe the ICMP traffic in WireShark and the command line ping activity (should start working again).Finally, stop the ping activity:

</p>
<br />
<br />

<h2>SSH Traffic Analysis</h2>

<br />
<p>
  Back in Wireshark, filter for SSH traffic only and from your Windows 10 VM, “SSH into” your Ubuntu virtual machine (via its private IP address). Type commands (ls, pwd, etc) into the linux SSH connection and observe SSH traffic spam in WireShark.
</p>
</p>
  Exit the SSH connection by typing ‘exit’ and pressing [return]:

<p>
<br />
<br />
  
  <h2>Observe DHCP Traffic </h2>

<br />
<p>
  Back in Wireshark, filter for DHCP traffic only. From your Windows 10 VM, attempt to issue your VM a new IP address from the command line (ipconfig /renew)
</p>
Observe the DHCP traffic appearing in WireShark:
</p>

</p>
<br />
<br />

 <h2>Observe DNS Traffic </h2>

<br />
<p>
  Back in Wireshark, filter for DNS traffic only.
</p>
<p>
  From your Windows 10 VM within a command line, use nslookup to see what google.com and disney.com’s IP addresses are and observe the DNS traffic being shown in WireShark:
</p>
<p>

</p>
<br />
<br />

<h2>Observe RDP Traffic </h2>

<br />
<p>
  Back in Wireshark, filter for RDP traffic only using "tcp.port==3389".
</p>
<p>
  This continuos transmission ensures a seamless remot desktop experience. even without direct user interaction, RDP sends periodic updates to maintain the session.
</p>

  Through this project, we succesfully explored the dynamic network interaction between two Azure Virtual Machines while emploting wire shark for deep traffic analysis. By configuring Network Security Groups, we gained valuable insights into how security measures affect the flow of ICMP traffic and other protocols.This excercise enhanced my understanding of network behavior in cloud enviroments and showcased the importance of effective security configurations.
 
  <h2>CLEAN UP YOUR AZURE ENVIROMENT  </h2>
  
  Close your Remote Desktop connection, delete the Resource Group(s) created at the beginning of this tutorial, and verify Resource Group deletion.
